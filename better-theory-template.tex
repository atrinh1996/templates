\section*{Calculational proof}
    Here are some examples of \LaTeX commands that could help you write a
    calculational proof.

    Writing a code chunk on a line: \texttt{(length (append xs ys))}.

    And here's a chunk of a calculational proof:
    \begin{codeproof}
    \pterm{{\Tt{}(length (append xs ys))\nwendquote}}
    \pfeqonly{ by assumption, $\mathtt{xs} = \mbox{\texttt{(cons z zs)}}$ }
    \pterm{\Tt{}(length (append (cons z zs) ys))}
    \pfeqonly{ append-cons law }
    \pterm{\Tt{}(length (cons z (append zs ys))}
    \end{codeproof}

\section*{Inference Rules}
% Here are some examples of LaTeX commands that could help you on the opsem
% assignment.

Verbatim code: \verb|(if x 2 3)|

Another way to put text in code font: \texttt{x}.

Putting text in the font to name rules: \textsc{IfFalse}.

% Here is an example of two rules appearing one over the other:

\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule*[Right=\textsc{Literal}]
          {\ }
          {\evalr{\textsc{literal}(v)}
               \Downarrow
           \state{v}{\xi}{\phi}{\rho}}
\end{mathpar}
\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule*[Right=\textsc{FormalVar}]
          {x \in \texttt{dom}\ \rho}
           {\evalr{\textsc{var}(x)}
                \Downarrow
            \state{\rho(x)}{\xi}{\phi}{\rho}}
\end{mathpar}

% And here is an example of a derivation (where I've shortened the abstract syntax
\textsc{literal} to \textsc{lit}):

\begin{mathpar}
\inferrule*[Left=\textsc{FormalAssign}]
  {\texttt{n} \in \texttt{dom}\ \rho
   \and
   \inferrule*[Right=\textsc{Literal}]
     {\ }
     {\evalr{\textsc{lit}(\texttt{0})} \Downarrow \evalr{0}} 
  }
  {\evalr{\textsc{set}(\textsc{var}(\texttt{n}), 
                      \textsc{lit}(\texttt{0}))}
